1.  pseudocode steps and logic
2.  established basic board creating 9 boxes, added a hover effect for testing purposes
3.  started Jquery and JS - setting up listeners to listen for when player clicks on boxes
    -roadblock - boxes would distort itself when an 'X' or 'O' would be inputted. Made a 'hack' fix
    by placeholding the box with a space... Will find a better way after MVP is established.
4.  ran into issue using while loops - refactored into if and else statements only
5.  MVP established - set or statements which took in array of each number saved by which player
    and used .include in order to determine which number was clicked
