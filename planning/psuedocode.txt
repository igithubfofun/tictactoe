- on click function needed to accept user's click/input and output either an 'X' or an 'O'
  - in function use 'this' so that when 'this' is clicked the 'X' or 'O' is placed in 'this' box

- second player clicks box - need to differentiate between who is player 1 and player 2 so that it outputs
  'X' or 'O' respectively.
  - user inputs should not be able to overwrite previous input

- when 3 consecutive boxes are the same output then display that the user with that symbol wins
